Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) compatible implementation of [XFeat: Accelerated Features for Lightweight Image Matching](https://github.com/verlab/accelerated_features/tree/main). The ONNX model format allows for interoperability across different platforms with support for multiple execution providers, and removes Python-specific dependencies such as PyTorch.
Source code in C++ is also provided to test the model!.

## Installation
TODO or Pip install something.

## Usage
### Inference
TODO

## Caveats
As the ONNX Runtime has limited support for features like dynamic control flow, certain configurations of the models cannot be exported to ONNX easily. These caveats are outlined below.

### Feature Extraction
- Only batch size `1` is currently supported. This limitation stems from the fact that different images in the same batch can have varying numbers of keypoints, leading to non-uniform (a.k.a. *ragged*) tensors.
For this reason the code differ from the original project: batch operations have been removed.

### Multiscale
- Actually Dense Multiscale model is not supported. Possible Future Work!

### Keypoints location
- To compare the Pytorch/Onnx/C++ models, the images in the assets folder were used. It can be seen in the results that the Python Pytorch/ONNX results are very similar to each other. For the C++ part, the results may vary slightly, particularly with a noticeable upward sliding of points compared to the Python versions. However, when using the images without applying padding (image_800x608), the sliding does not occur. Could some scaling/rounding factor be getting lost somewhere?
