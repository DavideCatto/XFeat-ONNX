Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) compatible implementation of [XFeat: Accelerated Features for Lightweight Image Matching](https://github.com/verlab/accelerated_features/tree/main). The ONNX model format allows for interoperability across different platforms with support for multiple execution providers, and removes Python-specific dependencies such as PyTorch.

## Introduction

## Installation
Pip install something.

## Usage
### Inference


## Caveats
As the ONNX Runtime has limited support for features like dynamic control flow, certain configurations of the models cannot be exported to ONNX easily. These caveats are outlined below.

### Feature Extraction
- Only batch size `1` is currently supported. This limitation stems from the fact that different images in the same batch can have varying numbers of keypoints, leading to non-uniform (a.k.a. *ragged*) tensors.
